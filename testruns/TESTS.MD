Tried
- social media webscraping
- saving scraped content to file
- reading scraped content from file
- creating social media posts from it
- saving the posts to file

didnt work cause the tool the ai wanted to use was not writefile instead write file

used latest chatgpt vrsion 3.5 so he can handle this.

agent was now scraping but didnt understand the text and didnt make good posts at all
was just a random text blob. probably not specific enough in the goals.
